Парень не неси ерунды, Disciples признана многими игроками, хотя я и не фанат данной игры она достойна топа. Варик это да, Действительно лучшая игра, можно сказать инновационная в своё время. из серии warhammer 40,000 лучшие на мой взгляд это soulstorm Hiya, I picked up WotC over the Christmas break and am absolutely loving it. However, one thing I'm missing is the base XCOM 2 soundtrack with the more upbeat squad select music I've loved during my playthrough of the non-expac Ironman run. The Soundtrack selection only shows choices for UFO Defense, Enemy Unknown, and War of the Chosen. Is there a mod or something that lets you get the original soundtrack back? Thanks in advance. 
Шесть лет назад Амелия в один день потеряла мужа и родила сына. Сэмуэлю идёт уже седьмой год, но ему везде мерещатся чудовища. I'm continuing my Let's Play-series of UFO: Enemy Unknown (aka. X-Com: UFO Defense) on YouTube. I'm playing on superhuman difficulty with an ironman mindset, so no loading if and when things go wrong. I've also used XComUtil to fix the notorious difficulty bug, so the game will actually be on superhuman difficulty and not beginner.

Over the years there have been some outstanding creations in the games industry. But which were the golden oldies in your opinion? I'm talking about genre-defining creations like Ultima Online ( Dungeon Keeper (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N5ODEGR1KQ), UFO - Enemy Unknown (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0fOFXTnnlI), The Secret Of Monkey Island (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFPFFZs5m_w), etc. The true innovations of yesteryear that defined So here we are, this is the first time I do this kind of topic, so maybe the form and the content will change in the next weeks.

What is the best pistol, shotgun, and assualt rifle you can get? I got the guass sniper and the best cannon weapon which are both better than magnetic already but the other guns haven't yielded a new option. 2. I've built power relays on the 2 coil spots although some sources say its better to build psi-ops and shadow buildings on these as they are power mongers. Any know which is better; like I say, I've heard different opinions on this. 3. Advent counter - mines about Here's a puush. (sry for my english, english isn't my first language) This haircut is the EXACT same as the basic character preset in UFO - Enemy Unknown: I got that haircut on two characters, coming with the XCOM EU basic armor equipped The weird thing is that when I tried to customize the haircut, it disappeared, since. I'm a massive fan of the original X-COM:UFO Defense (Enemy Unknown to some regions) and have been waiting for a new X-COM since, the new X-COM recently released seems like it would please my needs in a new X-COM game expect for the fact that I can only have 4 guys in my squad now, and that everything seems lacking, as well as the fact that the game is known to still be exponentially buggy, I won't go into details but I'm sure you'll of heard of them, its possible for me to overlook Back in the day I played UFO : Enemy Unknown and I loved it , I would like to play this one too but for this sale I got no money.

Preface: Let me start by saying I am a veteran of gaming, having grown up from the speccy 48k, through Amiga and every combo of pc. I bought one of the original 3D accelerator cards to play tomb raider on pc. I remember eagerly copying doom shareware so we could all experience it. I’ve played countless hours of multiplayer doom, quake 1&2, ut and so on. I used to host small lanparties.

I guess, it will be unpopular opinion. I played few games, want to share some unpopular opinion on the basis on xcom series. Xcom: Ufo Defense (1994): 14 dudes in a default dropship(28 at the end of the game), armed with great firepower, able to unleash hell on everything they face. Up to 9 shots in a row from a single soldier. Our finances allow us to buy ships and stuff and build bases and whatever.

(1856 or 57 -1943) Since he died in 1943, many nations have secretly developed his beam weapons which now further refined are so powerful that just by satellite one can: make a nuclear like destruction; earthquake; hurricane; tidal wave; cause instant freezing - killing every living.
